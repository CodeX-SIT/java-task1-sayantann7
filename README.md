# Java-Task1 — Introductory Java Exercises

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Java exercises built around the following topics:

1. Introduction to Java + Installing Java JDK and IntelliJ IDEA for Java
2. Basic Structure of a Java Program: Understanding our First Java Hello World Program
3. Variables and Data Types in Java Programming
4. Literals in Java
5. Getting User Input in Java
6. Operators, Types of Operators & Expressions in Java
7. Associativity of Operators in Java
8. Data Type of Expressions & Increment/Decrement Operators

## Work to Complete

- **q1**: A fill-in-the-blanks exercise focusing on basic program structure, variables, data types, and simple output.
- **q2**: A complete program exercise that practices user input, operators, expressions, and basic calculations.
- **q3**: A program demonstrating literals, increment/decrement operators, data type conversions, and operator associativity.

Each question lives in its own folder (`q1/`, `q2/`, `q3/`) and contains:

- `qX.java` — the source file (either a template with "// FILL HERE" comments or a blank starter file).
- `README.md` — clear instructions, expected input/output, and what to fill/implement.

## How to Compile & Run (Windows)

Using Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
# compile
javac q1/q1.java
javac q2/q2.java
javac q3/q3.java

# run
java -cp q1 q1
java -cp q2 q2
java -cp q3 q3
```

Alternative method (from each question's directory):

```bash
# For q1
cd q1
javac q1.java
java q1

# For q2
cd q2
javac q2.java
java q2

# For q3
cd q3
javac q3.java
java q3
```

## What to Submit

- Edit the `q1/q1.java`, `q2/q2.java`, and `q3/q3.java` files to implement the solutions requested in their READMEs.
- Commit and push your changes to **YOUR FORKED REPOSITORY**.

## Grading Hints

- **Correctness**: Output must match the expected sample output in each question's README.
- **Readability**: Use meaningful variable names and proper Java naming conventions.
- **Demonstration of concepts**: Show that you understand:
  - Basic Java program structure
  - Variables and data types
  - Literals and their usage
  - User input with Scanner
  - Operators and expressions
  - Increment/decrement operations
  - Data type conversions

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of command line/terminal usage
- Text editor (VSCode Recommended) or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

Proceed to the `q1/`, `q2/`, and `q3/` folders and complete the exercises in order.
